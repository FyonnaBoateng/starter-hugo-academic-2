Hi there! My name is Fyonna Boateng and I am a Psychology undergraduate at the University of Reading.

I have a developing interest in the relationship between social sciences and data science/analytics. This portfolio will document my progress as I teach myself Python, SQL, and LaTeX. I will more specifically focus on learning how to use Python to analyse data, and potentially learn basic machine learning (ML).

I hope to be able to make sense of scattered, heterogenous data in order to assist in making informed decisions based on human behaviour.

Thanks so much for visiting and I hope that my site is enjoyable to visit. This entire site is designed using my GitHub.

NB: Anything following this section of my website is currently a work in progress as I become more familiar with GitHub and Markdown. Thank you :) 

Fy
